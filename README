irssi-python test1

irssi-python embeds Python into an Irssi module, providing most of the
functionality of the Perl wrapper to Python scripts using a similar interface.
Read INSTALL for setup instructions.

Currently, all of the objects and functions are accessible through the irssi
module. See docs/irssi-python.html for a listing. Basic docs are also available
online in Irssi, as well. Use the /pyexec command to send commands to the Python
interpreter while in Irssi. 

This will print help for the Window object:
    /pyexec import irssi
    /pyexec help(irssi.Window)

Other commands (XXX: change these to /py <cmd>):
    /pyload     load a Python script
    /pyunload   unload a Python script
    /pylist     list loaded scripts
